          We see building strong and lasting relationships as an essential component of our growth. Both in relationships with our clients, partners, or acquisitions; we ensure all business transactions are carried out on the foundation of goodwill and a healthy business environment. This statement is a core cultural belief and a fundamental element of the success of OakSide Investments. Members of our community tend to share core values that are highly compatible with those that are central to the business and established at the outset — expertise, integrity and discretion. We treat each other with mutual respect, openness and fairness and are driven by a desire to ‘do the right thing’ by all our stakeholders. This is our culture – it is central to our success. We are therefore proactive in building and reinforcing it. </p>

		  <p><b>Franklin J Stapler</b> is a financial advisor who first became aware of the stock market when his father purchased a few shares of Church’s Fried Chicken stock for him in the mid 1970’s. The stock was also purchased for his 2 siblings, who eventually sold their stock and took the cash. At the age of 14, Franklin J Stapler sold his stock as well, but decided to take his proceeds and reinvest. He had a passion for baseball cards at the time, and decided to purchase shares of Topps, a leading baseball card distributor. Over the next few years, Franklin J Stapler doubled his money and he was hooked.</p>

		  <p>Always fascinated with numbers, he earned his BBA in Finance from Southwest Texas State University in 1985, with a specialization in Financial Planning. Upon graduation in 1985, he immediately went to work for Fidelity Investments in Dallas, Texas as a mutual fund trader. In just a few months, Franklin J Stapler’s job expanded to cover all 50 states and he was awarded duties of helping out the sales team at Fidelity.</p>

		  <p>His opportunity to meet with clients on an individual basis came in 1996, when he became a financial advisor for a growing money management firm in San Antonio, Texas. During his 14 years of dedication to the firm, assets under management grew tenfold and Franklin J Stapler eventually served as the Chief Trader, in charge of trading millions every day.</p>

		  <p>This position landed him his own syndicated daily radio show airing in Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Colorado Springs, & Denver. With the growing popularity of the program, Franklin J Stapler was invited by various financial news networks for his commentary on the markets as well. Some of the networks on which he has appeared include CNBC, CNBC Asia, Bloomberg, Fox Business, & Reuters. Franklin J Stapler enjoys offering public discourse on the state of the economy and the financial markets whenever possible.</p>

		  
		</div>
	  </div>
	  
	  <div class="row">
		
		<div class="col-md-12" style="text-align: justify;">
		  <p>In 2001, Franklin J Stapler established  OakSide Investments, a registered investment advisory firm dedicated to providing clients with superior financial counsel in the changing economy. His market insight and investment strategies help fulfill the mission of OakSide Investments to help clients in the face of a rapidly changing market. </p>
		  
		  <p>Other major successes in OakSide Investments’s life include his family. He met his wife Amy in college and they were married in 1997. With their 2 children, Adrain and Avery, Franklin and Amy currently reside in Sandpoint, Idaho.</p>
		  
		  <p>Now let’s talk about OakSide Investments. I’ve always thought that you could learn a lot about an organization by how it responds to change. Does it rigidly stand its ground and eventually lose its relevance? Or does it blow like a seed in the winds of change until it becomes an unrecognizable version of its former self? When it comes to navigating change, I prefer a more grounded, but nimble approach: staying rooted in a timeless principle, while adapting how that principle is brought to life. More and more, I am absolutely convinced that this timeless principle – the very future of financial advice itself – is independent, objective advice.</p>

		  <p>The aim of these activities is to obtain current market information through continuing market operations and to contribute to the financing of our management costs. These activities enable us to conduct small and large equity transactions in a cost-efficient manner and with low brokerage fees. It is gratifying to note that we earned more than $20 billion as profit investing  on Forex and CFD trading, Crypto Currency, Real Estate, Renewable Energy, Stocks and NFP for the second year in a row, which more than amply covered our management costs. </p>

		  <p>Through hard work, OakSide Investments’s portfolio  have attained leading positions in their respective areas. Their operations have wide international coverage, with strong positions in the world’s largest economies, such as North America, Europe, Australia and Asia – areas that account for more than half of global GDP. Moreover, our portfolio have a growing share of their sales in emerging markets around the world . By looking forward and with a longer time perspective, you can get a feeling for what development and urbanization of the world’s growth countries can entail. The United Nations projects that the world’s population will grow by 20%, to 8.5 billion people, in the coming 20 years – essentially all in growth countries. During the same period, global GDP is expected to double in real terms. Rising prosperity in countries like China, India, Brazil and Russia is creating opportunities for OakSide Investments’s portfolio companies that are active primarily in industrial and infrastructure products, which are key areas associated with rapidly growing prosperity in emerging countries. I am highly confident that  OakSide Investments – through their strong positions – have the conditions and ability to capitalize on these opportunities to the benefit of our clients.</p>
		  
		  <h4 class="title text-left">Active ownership with focus and flexibility</h4>
		  <p>For an active owner it is of decisive importance to gain a good picture of a portfolio company’s business and business environment, and to have an opinion about the company’s future performance. Global companies are encountering a more competitive and rapidly changing world in many respects. In part, the macroeconomic conditions are shifting between various countries and regions, and in part, a number of rapid shifts are taking place as a result of revolutionary mega trends, including digitalization, urbanization and greater focus on sustainability. No company can foresee in detail how these factors will affect their business. However, companies can mitigate their risks and enhance their opportunities if they focus their business on what they are good at and succeed at strengthening their structural flexibility. This can be achieved through greater decentralization, increased financial scope to act, and perhaps most important of all, through continuous improvements in their own operations. As an active owner we believe that a clear business focus, distinct customer orientation and keen ability to adapt are vital factors for being able to generate a competitive return over time.  </p>
		  
		  <h4 class="title text-left">Satisfactory growth processes but a number of challenges</h4>
		  <h5 class="description text-left" >The macroeconomic conditions from 2019-2022 are expected to remain favorable, and as in 2018, global growth is projected to be around 4%. It can be noted that most of the major economies are now expected to show growth in 2020, although to varying degrees. In the longer term the question is when the economy will level out and at what pace this will happen.</h5>
		  
		  <p>In Europe the recovery has been good, and the political risks have decreased slightly after several elections and the start of Brexit negotiations. Growth in the U.S. remains favorable. It is hard to assess the overall effect of the recent tax reform and possible infrastructure investments, but they are expected to have a positive effects on growth. In China, growth has stabilized at a relatively favorable level. Several emerging countries are bene ting from a weaker U.S. dollar, which has strengthened their competitiveness.</p>

		  <p>From a geopolitical perspective there are a number of areas of concern that are giving rise to uncertainty region- ally as well as for the global economy. Despite these, a stable macro environment and strong company performance contributed to the stock market’s favorable performance in 2018. Forex, CFD Trading, NFP, Renewable Energy  and Real Estate continued to develop positively during the beginning of 2018, but in early February a correction occurred in stocks market and the volatility increased, due to concerns about the US stock market. Although the market has shown a clear concern about rising in action and interest rates, the macro forecasts for 2019/2022, earnings growth for companies and high interest rates, point to an underlying support in the stock market. However, in the future there are expectations of higher interest rates and reduced stimulus measures.</p>
		  
		  <h5 class="title text-left">We are broadening our investment universe </h5>
		  <p>OakSide Investments will continue to invest in listed profitable companies with good return potential. Our active ownership will build upon a foundation of trust and ownership based influence. Our share of ownership should therefore be at least 10% of the votes. We are now broadening our investment universe by also looking at slightly smaller companies. For new investments, a candidate should have a minimum market cap of roughly $3 billion. If we invest in a company with a market cap of  $3–10 billion, a 20%–30% equity stake is desirable. The idea is to have a genuine position of influence and that the investment’s potential return will make a tangible contribution to the equities portfolio as a whole. </p>
		  
		  <h5 class="title text-left">Strong position for competitive returns over time</h5>
		  <p>OakSide Investments is in a favorable position to conduct successful, long-term asset management based on active ownership. Starting from our strengths, a professional organization and the development steps we are now taking, I look forward to leading the business to generate competitive shareholder value over time. </p>

		  <p>All of us at OakSide Investments are proud of the fact that we’ve been one of the nation’s best investment platform for more than 15 years. That’s a great legacy. But personally, I’m more excited about the next 20 years for OakSide Investments. Working with an extraordinary group of financial advisors to lead the independent advice model into the future is a pretty great opportunity, and I can’t wait to work on that future together with our advisors to generate more profit for our clients.</p>
